## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- MetaMask browser extension
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd chennai-community-funding
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Compile the smart contracts:
   ```
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

4. Run tests:
   ```
   npx hardhat test
   ```

5. Deploy to local network:
   ```
   npx hardhat node
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```

6. Deploy to testnet (e.g., Sepolia):
   ```
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
   ```

7. Update the contract address in `frontend/js/contract-config.js` with the deployed contract address.

8. Open the frontend application:
   ```
   # Use the included server script
   node start-frontend.js

   # Or use any simple HTTP server, e.g.:
   cd frontend
   npx http-server
   ```

9. For Windows users, you can use the one-click startup script:
   ```
   start-dapp.bat
   ```

## Smart Contract

The `ProjectFunding.sol` contract includes the following main functions:

- `createProject`: Create a new community project
- `donateToProject`: Donate ETH to a specific project
- `withdrawFunds`: Allow the beneficiary to withdraw collected funds
- `completeProject`: Mark a project as completed
- `toggleFundingStatus`: Pause or resume funding for a project
- Various getter functions to retrieve project and donation information

## Frontend

The frontend application provides an intuitive interface for:

- Browsing all community projects
- Creating new project proposals
- Making donations to projects
- Viewing project details and donation history
- Managing projects (for project owners)

## Preserving Projects Between Contract Deployments

When you redeploy your contract, all on-chain data is lost. This DApp includes a solution to preserve your projects:

### Exporting Projects

Before redeploying your contract, export your projects:

```
npx hardhat run scripts/exportProjects.js --network localhost
```

This will save all projects to `data/projects-backup.json`.

### Importing Projects

After deploying a new contract, import your projects:

```
npx hardhat run scripts/importProjects.js --network localhost
```

This will recreate all projects from the backup file.

### Updating Contract Address

When you deploy a new contract, update the contract address in:

```
frontend/js/contract-config.js
```
